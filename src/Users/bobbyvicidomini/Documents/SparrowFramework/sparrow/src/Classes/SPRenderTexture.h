/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 An SPRenderTexture is a dynamic texture on which you can draw any display object.
 
 After creating a render texture, just call the `drawObject:` method to render an object directly 
 onto the texture. The object will be drawn onto the texture at its current position, adhering 
 its current rotation, scale and alpha properties. 
 
 Drawing is done very efficiently, as it is happening directly in graphics memory. After you have 
 drawn objects on the texture, the performance will be just like that of a normal texture - no
 matter how many objects you have drawn.
 
 If you draw lots of objects at once, it is recommended to bundle the drawing calls in a block
 via the `bundleDrawCalls:` method, like shown below. That will speed it up immensely, allowing
 you to draw hundreds of objects very quickly.
 
	[renderTexture bundleDrawCalls:^
	 {
	     for (int i=0; i<numDrawings; ++i)
	     {
	        image.rotation = (2 * PI / numDrawings) * i;
	        [renderTexture drawObject:image];            
	     }             
	 }]; 

 One thing you should be aware of is that calling any of this class' drawing methods from within
 a `render:` method of an `SPDisplayObject` may lead to problems with texture bindings. To
 circumvent this, either move your drawing code into an enter frame event listener or call the
 `reset` method of `SPRenderSupport` after the drawing calls.
