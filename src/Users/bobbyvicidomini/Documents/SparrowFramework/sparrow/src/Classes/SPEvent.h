/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The SPEvent class contains data that describes an event.
 
 `SPEventDispatcher`s create instances of this class and send them to registered listeners. An event
 contains information that characterizes an event, most importantly the event type and if the event 
 bubbles. The target of an event is the object that dispatched it.
 
 For some event types, this information is sufficient; other events may need additional information 
 to be carried to the listener. 
 In that case, you can subclass SPEvent and add properties with all the information you require. 
 The SPEnterFrameEvent is an example for this practice; it adds a property about the time that
 has passed since the last frame.
 
 Furthermore, the event class contains methods that can stop the event from being processed by
 other listeners - either completely or at the next bubble stage.
