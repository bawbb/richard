/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 An SPDelayedInvocation is a proxy object that will forward any methods that are called on it
 to a certain target - but only after a certain time has passed.
 
 The easiest way to delay an invocation is by calling [SPJuggler delayInvocationAtTarget:byTime:].
 This method will create a delayed invocation for you, adding it to the juggler right away.
